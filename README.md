## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Opens last compiled version in electron

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run compile`

### `npm run compile-start`

Compiles current code to build folder and starts electron

### `npm run electron-build`
